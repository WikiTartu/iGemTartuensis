<h1>Composite Parts</h1>


<p>
A composite part is a functional unit of DNA consisting of two or more basic parts assembled together. <a href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_I13507">BBa_I13507</a> is an example of a composite part, consisting of an RBS, a protein coding region for a red fluorescent protein, and a terminator.
</p>

<p>New composite BioBrick devices can be made by combining existing BioBrick Parts (like Inverters, Amplifiers, Smell Generators, Protein Balloon Generators, Senders, Receivers, Actuators, and so on).</p>
